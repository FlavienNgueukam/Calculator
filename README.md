# Calculator

This code creates a scientific calculator using the Tkinter library in Python.

## Key features:

- Extensive button layout: Includes basic arithmetic operators, scientific functions (square root, factorial, exponent, logarithm), memory functions (CE), and navigation/correction buttons.
- Dynamic button click handling: Each button triggers a specific action based on its assigned value.
- Error handling: Attempts to evaluate user input using eval, catches and displays exceptions for invalid expressions.
- Clean and organized: Code is well-structured with comments and consistent variable naming.

## Function breakdown:

- __init__: Initializes the calculator window, entry field, and arranges buttons in a grid layout.
- button_click: Handles user interaction with buttons by updating the entry field based on the button's function (inserting operators, functions, clearing, evaluating).
- eval_expression: (Not explicitly defined but used in button_click) Evaluates the mathematical expression entered in the field and updates the result.

  
## Overall, this code provides a comprehensive and functional scientific calculator interface using python Tkinter. You can add more functionalities such as memory functions.
